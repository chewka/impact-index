","City-wide water efficiency and goals

The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (Water Authority) provides water and wastewater service to the residents of the City of Albuquerque. In 2016, the Water Authority adopted a 100-year water management plan, Water 2120, that includes 12 policies that address water management and resources; Policies E and K include sub-policies that address energy efficiency, green stormwater, and water savings. The Water Authority understands that green energy and efficient energy programs translate into water conservation In line with the policies and goals of Water 2120, the Water Authority has a program to increase energy and water efficiency at multi-family buildings in the City. To meet the energy efficiency goals, the Water Authority Conservation team has an agreement with the electrical utility, PNM, to promote efficient energy use at these buildings through education and infrastructure.

In 2018, the Water Authority adopted an updated Water Conservation Plan which sets a new usage goal of 110 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) by 2037. Currently, the water usage is 128 GPCD which translates into a reduction of approximately 1 gallon per person per day in order to meet the conservation usage goal.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

The Water Authority is in the process of developing its Environmental Plan, which includes sub-policies to incorporate energy efficient practices into the long-term plan for the Water Authority. Additionally, the Decade Plan for the Water Authority identifies projects that will increase energy efficiency and alternative energy sources.

Methane capture at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) supplies power to the WWTP and periodically is able to meet the energy demand of the WWTP with methane capture alone. The Water Authority has identified improvements to the digesters and treatment system to continue to increase efficiency and maximize energy generated through biogas/methane capture. Additionally, the Water Authority recently completed a study to look at feasibility and possible benefits of incorporating Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) collected commercially to increase biogas energy generation while simultaneously addressing an ongoing operation and maintenance issue of FOG in the wastewater.

","","8 out of 30 points","","Location Efficient Zoning Codes

The Integrated Development Ordinance (IDO), Albuquerque�s zoning code, does not require transit-oriented development, compact or mixed land use development, street connectivity, or form-based zoning. However: there are three zone modifiers � UC, PT, and MS � respectively Urban Center, Premium Transit, and Main Street � that act as overlays to increase building heights, lessen setbacks, increase density, lower parking requirements, and so on. These overlays have the effect of encouraging TOD or other more compact, mixed use forms.

Residential Parking Policies

The IDO reduced parking minimums for most uses citywide compared to the previous zoning code. It also instituted marking maximums for certain uses (large offices and retail) in key Center and Corridor areas. It also carries forward regulations from the old zoning system that eliminate parking minimums in certain neighborhoods in and near downtown, as well as for many uses in pre-1965 buildings. See Table 5-5-1 and Subsection 5-5(B)(2)(a) of the IDO.

Location Efficiency Incentives and Disclosure

The IDO offers an additional story (12 feet of building height) for development in mixed-use zones on pedestrian-oriented corridors and within 330 feet of Premium transit stops as a bonus to encourage compact, mixed-use development. The IDO offers 1-2 stories (depending on zone) for development that incorporates a parking structure (as an incentive for an alternative to large sea of parking). The IDO reduced parking requirements for most uses. The City also has a height bonus in one area (Nob Hill) to allow for 12 additional feet of building height for developments with ground floor commercial space in order to encourage mixed-use development. There is also a provision for Major and Premium Transit Corridors west of the river that in mixed-use zone districts, there have to be commercial uses along at least 50% of the fa�ade of the building if the development includes townhouses or multi-family development. The IDO allows most development to be approved administratively by staff in an expedited process compared to the previous approvals required by Sector Plans in over half the City.

The ABC Comp Plan encourages mixed-use development in Areas of Change and most Centers and Corridors, which can be used to support zone changes to mixed-use zone districts in these areas. Areas of Change and Centers and Corridors are the areas in the city that have been identified as the most appropriate for more dense, intense development and more multimodal transportation options to support that development.

","Mode Shift Targets

The City has a transit mode share goal of an aggregate of 20% of trips to be taken on priority corridors by transit by 2040.

Progress Achieved Toward Mode Shift Targets

Transit Mode share in the region changed slightly, from 1.36% in 2012 to 1.28% in 2014. On Albuquerque�s primary transit corridor, Central Ave., transit mode share increased from 12.8% in 2012 to 12.9% in 2014. In downtown Albuquerque, transit mode share exceeds 30%.

Complete Streets

Albuquerque adopted its complete streets policy in 2015 through Ordinance O-14-27. The adoption of the policy includes requirements to improve roadways to better facilitate bicycle traffic and freight mobility.

Car Sharing

The City does not currently have a formal policy in place to provide dedicated on-street and off-street parking for carshare vehicles. However, there is a proposal to add a provision to the IDO that would give a parking credit for dedicated off-street carshare spaces (proposal that 1 carshare space would count for 4 required parking spaces, which is consistent with a similar credit for carpool spaces).

Bike Sharing

Currently, the City has one bikeshare provider, Pace, which is publicly funded through the Mid-region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MRMPO) using federal grant funding. Because the program is publicly funded, there is no charge for the permits for station in the public right-of-way or on public property. The Pace system is a hybrid docked/dockless system, which encourages use of bikeshare because users are not required to locate a docking station when they use a bike. In partnership with the Mid-Region Council of Governments (MRCOG), 50 PACE bike share stations are located in the City, with a total of 250 bicycles, which are docked.

EV Charging Locations

The City owns 20 charging stations available for public use.

Renewable Charging Incentives

At this time, the City of Albuquerque has no incentives or requirements available for the installation of private or public EV charging infrastructure powered by renewable energy (solar, wind, etc.). However, future goals are to install EV Charging infrastructure at existing renewable energy sites like community centers to incentivize the use EVs.

Since 2012, Austin Water has also been transitioning to 100% renewable energy through participation in Austin Energy�s Green Choice program, which supports the purchase of renewable energy. The Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant recently upgraded an old combined heat and power (CHP) facility. Since March 2013, this new facility has been generating 100% of its heat and electricity demand through combustion of the ~700,000 cubic feet per day of biogas produced onsite through anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge.

","Fleet Policies and Composition

The 2007�executive order�on climate action required that municipal departments purchase hybrid, alternative-fueled, or high-efficiency vehicles whenever possible; new motor vehicles shall be the most fuel-efficient within their vehicle class. Boston also has established a motor pool,�FleetHub, using car-sharing technology, allowing the city to reduce the fleet size and maximize the use of existing stock.�Additionally, Boston Public Schools has made significant efforts to increase school bus routing efficiency and replace the oldest, least efficient diesel school buses with cleaner propane vehicles. Collectively, these efforts have led to 2,650,824 fewer miles driven by Boston Public School diesel buses. Boston�s fleet is composed of 7.3% efficient vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles.�

Public Lighting

Boston has not yet adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association�s Model Lighting Ordinance. However, the Energy Reduction Plan specifies a 40% reduction goal for energy use of streetlights in the city. The City of Boston is currently retrofitting its mercury and sodium vapor lighting to LED luminaires. To date, 76.3% of the City�s 64,000 electric street lights have been retrofitted, resulting in 35.6 million kWh in annual electriCity savings. The city's goal is to replace all of its streetlights with LEDs over the next few years.

Green Building Requirements�

The 2007�executive order�directed that all new municipal buildings must be LEED Silver Certified, and new and renovated buildings must exceed LEED energy standards by 14 and 7 percent, respectively. Projects funded by the city under the Department of Neighborhood Development�s�Green Affordable Housing Program�must also meet the LEED Silver standards.

These savings values are for the utilities� entire Massachusetts service territory, not just Boston. Eversource offers electric efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and commercial/industrial customers. National Grid similarly offers natural gas efficiency programs to residential and business customers. Both utilities also sponsor whole-building programs, including multifamily buildings, through the state-wide Mass Save program. Their �whole facility� approach focuses on a facility�s thermal envelope (shell insulation and air leakage conditions for units heated by natural gas or electricity) as well as lighting and mechanical systems.

The City of Boston partners with its energy utilities through the Renew Boston program. Renew Boston promotes energy efficient choices and informs Boston residents and businesses about utility-sponsored energy efficiency services. Through its community-centric outreach and education, Renew Boston helps ensure that the City's diverse homes and businesses are connected to available energy efficiency programs and incentives. Eversource continues to lend the City a manager that aids the City with energy efficiency project uptake and implementation. Moreover, the City and utilities are partnering on a joint marketing effort to increase residential home energy efficiency activities in Boston�s low- and middle-income neighborhoods, with a focus on increasing home energy audits, weatherization, and heating system upgrades.

The City of Boston also takes an active role in advising the utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs through a seat on the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC). The Massachusetts Green Communities Act of 2008 created the EEAC to assist in the development and implementation of the statewide gas and electric utility energy efficiency plans. These plans set three-year targets for electricity and natural gas savings. The EEAC did not include representation from Massachusetts' municipal governments until Boston advocated for the addition of a voting seat for an individual representing ""a city or town of the Commonwealth"" through An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth. That seat is currently represented by a City of Boston staff member.

MWRA has completed energy audits at 33 of its 36 major facilities. Audit recommendations and other process optimization efforts are estimated to save almost $2 million annually as part of the Long-Term Sustainability Program. MWRA continues to reduce its electrical demand by optimizing process operations and renewable generation�including wind, solar, hydroelectric and biogas�and implementation of energy efficiency measures. Over the past 5 years, they have achieved a reduction of over 10% or a total of 18M kWh. Recently, MWRA entered into a memorandum of agreement with Eversource to identify and implement energy efficiency opportunities throughout MWRA's day-to-day operations and construction programs, and also to achieve higher rebates from the utility for implementing energy efficiency projects. MWRA also calls out Environmental Sustainability as a key strategic priority in their Five-Year Strategic Business Plan for FY 2016�2020. These initiatives include continuing to audit all facilities on their regular audit schedule, optimization of processes, cost effective renewable energy deployments, continued maximization of GHG reductions and fully leveraging all available utility rebates and incentives for energy efficiency.

The Central Park Pumping Station began construction in Dec 2018 for a similar conversion. The department estimates an annual savings of $4.5M in energy and maintenance expenses.

MWRD has also implemented a sewer thermal heat and cooling system to save energy at its water reclamation plant, where methane is also collected for electricity generation. Moreover, the MWRD operates several anaerobic digesters, generating up to one-third of its energy from the digestion process. A new project will divert 440 tons a day of food waste from the city of Chicago�s solid waste stream, feed it into the digesters at the Calumet treatment plant in Chicago, generate 160% more methane gas, and sell some of this gas back into the natural gas pipeline.

The City adopted a Complete Streets Policy into its municipal code, and in the Zoning Regulations, it has an entire Chapter, Chapter 9, devoted to Complete Streets and street design.

Residential Parking Policies

In 2017, Hartford eliminated all minimum parking requirements for every zoning use (except for car sales lots, which are state mandated). It also imposes maximums on every parking use. The City instead imposes minimum requirements for bicycle parking for all but 1-, 2-, and 3-family uses.

Location Efficiency Incentives and Disclosure

The City requires through its Zoning Regulations compact development compatible with existing neighborhoods through Chapter 4 � its form-based code chapter. In addition, the City offers generous density bonuses for downtown and transit-oriented development districts when property owners provide particular amenities (see 4.3.2.E. and 4.4.2.E.). The Regulations also allow a full range of uses that have fast-track permitting (no public hearings) in districts citywide (see Figure 3.2-A).

One such assessment was conducted by the State of Tennessee in 2015, and the results noted KUB�s plants are extremely efficient and there is little more that can be done to improve efficiency. Still, KUB strives for efficiency in its water and wastewater operations, and recent efforts include:

Installation of more than 550 LED lights, with an annual savings of nearly 470,000 kWh annually.
	Participation in TVA�s Demand Response program to alleviate strain on the electric grid during periods of peak demand.
	Improvement to the aeration system at KUB�s largest wastewater treatment plant, Kuwahee, including installation of six dissolved oxygen probes and three new sensors to optimize efficiency.
	Implementation of an advanced technology solution to improve water loss from KUB�s water distribution system. KUB recently divided its water system into 44 district metered areas with over 100 sensors that capture flow and pressure data every five minutes. KUB implemented TaKaDu, a web-based data analytics software, to analyze the data and identify operational irregularities. These improvements are helping KUB identify and repair leaks more quickly.
In addition to water and energy conservation, KUB is a Platinum-level participant in the National Biosolids Partnership, through which all of the organic solids (approx. 33,000 wet tons per year) from the wastewater treatment process are certified as fertilizer by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and applied to regional farmlands at no cost to the farmers.

","City-wide water efficiency and goals

Long Beach Water Department (LBWD) has partnered with Southern California Edison to cross-promote rebates offered by both entities. A great example of this was a past rebate offered for communal high-efficiency coin/card operated clothes washer back in 2016. Additionally, LBWD hopes to partner in future direct installation programs that will streamline participation in water and energy device participation.

The Water Conservation Act of 2009, also known as the SBx7-7, set a statewide goal to reduce urban water use by 20% by the year 2020.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

In order for the State to achieve the 20% reduction goal, each retail urban water suppler is required to calculate its individual water use reduction target for the year 2020. LBWD is on track to meeting the 20 by 2020 target of 107 gallons per capita per day (GPCD). The Urban Management Plan updated every 5 years outlines all the strategies set by LBWD in meeting water savings. The most current document can be found here.

No specific targets have been set for energy efficiency. However, the department continues to consider this a priority moving forward. To date, the department has begun to analyze ways of increasing energy efficiency within the administration offices as a starting point. The City of Long Beach only collects sewage and then sends it to Los Angeles County sewer mains. The Los Angeles County Sanitation District is the wastewater treatment agency. Some of their facilities have co-generation capability.

Their goal is reducing the unaccounted-for water portion of the non-revenue water to 10% or less. WTDS recently completed a leak detection study of most of the water distribution system that searched for and identified leaks. In addition, the City�s residential meters are at the end of their useful life and are due for replacement. As a result, new meters will be installed over the next five years.

Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (Metro) came very close to meeting its 2015 energy goal of reducing energy purchases by 25% from 2006 levels. After reaching 23% reductions, a new goal was set to further reduce energy purchases by 10% between 2015 and 2020. Specific strategies to meet the goals include optimizing aeration processes, installing the Blue Lake wastewater treatment plant digester, installing the non-condensing steam turbine at the Metro wastewater treatment plant, and replacing the return- and waste-activated sludge pump drives at Metro.

The Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant currently uses incinerators to burn the biosolids removed from the treated water to create energy for the operations of the plant.

","City-wide water efficiency and goals

While the City of New York, which is a municipal water utility, does not jointly administer energy and water efficiency programs with private energy utilities, the energy utilities themselves offer water efficiency programs as a way to reduce both water and energy usage. Consolidated Edison provides energy-efficient and low-flow devices through their energy efficiency programs. National Grid has a Commercial Direct Install Program, which offers commercial customers no-cost installation of high-efficiency water and energy savings measures.

In 2014, NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) released the Water Demand Management Plan, a citywide program targeting a 5% overall reduction in water consumption citywide by year 2021. The plan consists of multiple strategies and more than 21 initiatives to achieve a target reduction of approximately 50 million gallons per day.

The Municipal Water Efficiency Program provides funding for water conservation and water efficiency projects in city-owned facilities. Under this program, DEP has identified opportunities for water savings in more than 2,000 city properties, with estimated water savings of over 9 million gallons of water per day by the end of the program. DEP has retrofitted 370 of 400 spray showers in City parks and installed high-efficiency fixtures in 240 schools to date; retrofits for 500 schools are planned. The porcelain from the schools is being recycled for an oyster bed project in Jamaica Bay as well as green infrastructure bioswales. DEP has also had success with its Water Challenge to waste water treatment plants, achieving 300,000 gallons per day in savings among 3 plants in 2015.

Under the Residential Water Efficiency Program, DEP launched a two-year Toilet Replacement Program in 2014. Phase I of the program offers $125 vouchers for qualified multifamily property owners who replace outdated toilets with high-efficiency models. Approximately 1,300 vouchers for approximately 14,200 toilets in total have been requested thus far.

The Non-Residential Water Efficiency Program promotes conservation in commercial and non-residential buildings through partnerships with the private sector. In the spring of 2013, DEP and the Mayor�s Office launched a water efficiency program called the New York City Water Challenge to Hotels, where eleven of the city�s premier hotels were challenged to reduce their consumption by 5% below 2012 levels. Similar programs targeting restaurants in 2015, and hospitals in 2016 are yielding meaningful water savings.

Additional DEP strategies under the Water Demand Management Program include Water Distribution System Optimization, Water Supply Shortage Management, and an Upstate Water Conservation Program. Most recently, DEP is developing a demand management program with our wholesale upstate customers. The first phase of this program is the provision of consulting services to assist upstate customers in developing demand management plans; the second phase will be the implementation of such plans. Demand management plans have been developed for eight upstate customers: The Village of Ossining, the Village of Tarrytown, Westchester Joint Water Works, the City of Mt. Vernon, the Village of Scarsdale, the Town of New Windsor, the Town of Greenburgh, and SUEZ Water Westchester (formerly United Water Westchester) that serves New Rochelle and other communities in lower Westchester.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

DEP completed energy audits at all 14 in-city wastewater treatment plants and has accepted over 130 energy conservation measures (ECMs) that have the potential to reduce energy use by 2.9 MMBTU per year. While there is no set annual �target� for energy efficiency, the Agency is currently working on an integration study to align those ECMs with State of Good Repair (SOGR) plans and projects so that ECMs are completed concurrently with ongoing, necessary maintenance and repair work at the 14 in-city plants. Additionally, DEP has a target to beneficially use 60% its anaerobic digester gas for thermal and/or electric energy by 2017. DEP currently produces over 3.5 billion cubic feet of anaerobic digester gas (ADG) per year, approximately 60% of which is made of methane. DEP beneficially uses approximately 40% of the produced anaerobic digester gas (ADG). These efforts support the reduction target set by PlaNYC, where city government buildings are to reduce their GHG emissions by 30% by 2017 from a 2005 baseline. Internally, DEP has implemented a Standard Operating Procedure to govern energy conservation and GHG reduction design considerations during the project design lifecycle, from the selection of the designer to commissioning of the installed equipment. Energy design guidelines for unit processes or equipment accompany the SOP and provide guidance on how to increase energy efficiency with any new facility construction or reconstruction projects.

At the Owl�s Head WWTP, there are three 1.6 MW dual fuel engines to generate electricity at the plant which offset approximately 40% of the plant�s electric needs. Moreover, The Coney Island WWTP has four 1.6 MW engine generators. These cogeneration units have been in service for over 30 years. The plant is generating over 80% of total electric power from these engines and utilizes nearly 100% digester gas production at plant. Looking ahead, DEP is designing a 16 MW cogeneration system at the North River WWTP which will be operated at an average of 10 MW and will use ADG and utility natural gas. The system, which will be in operation by 2020, will meet the plant�s base electrical demand and all thermal heating needs.

As a result, water use per capita has dropped 34% since 1996 and 6% in the last two years. The city also retrofits 200-250 income-qualified homes with high-efficiency fixtures and toilets. Currently, the energy and water utilities do not offer joint efficiency programs to residential or commercial customers. Additionally, the City has set nonrevenue water-saving goals at their water department, which are aimed at keeping annual water losses below 10%.

The Water Services Department (WSD) partners with local electric service providers to implement energy conservation measures at its facilities. To date, energy conservation measures from these programs have saved 5.8 million kWh annually. The WSD has joined the Department of Energy�s Better Plans Program, setting a goal to reduce energy intensity (KWh/million gallons) by 25% over a 10-year period, baseline year 2015. It is also participating in the DOE�s Wastewater Infrastructure Accelerator through the Better Buildings Program. The city-owned water utility also falls under the city-wide goal to reduce energy use by 20% by 2020 from 2009 levels despite a growing population and water services. The department goal is to operate at the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness and has upgraded many of the facilities and pumping stations. In 2018, one of the five ESCOs contracted by the City is under contract to updated water facilities to achieve the 20% reduction target.

Additionally, a large Energy Services Company (ESCO) is under contract to build and operate a facility recovery and clean-up digester gas that is currently being flared. In 2018, the City constructed and opened a $25M gas capture and treatment plant that will convert methane captured from wastewater to green gas and insert it into the natural gas pipeline�generating $6M annually in gross revenue. The facility will provide an annual energy offset of approximately 640,000 MMBtu, reducing carbon emissions by nearly 45,000 tons/year, which is the equivalent of taking over 70,000 cars off the road or planting over 87,000 acres of trees every year.

","City-wide water efficiency and goals

The City of San Diego�s Department of Water Utilities offers water use calculators for household and landscape use. There are also rebate programs available for micro irrigation, turf removal, and rain barrels. The City of San Diego is also a member of the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), which has been partnering with SDG&E for more than twenty years on administering water efficiency programs, such as low-flow showerheads, small business water efficiency equipment, leak loss detection, and education and outreach.

The City of San Diego�s Climate Action Plan has several water savings targets and long-term strategies to reach those targets. One target is to reduce daily per capita water consumption by 4 gallons by 2020 and 9 gallons by 2035 below 2010 levels. Action 1.3 of the Climate Action Plan directs the City to support water rate structures that provide pricing signals that encourage water conservation and reuse. Action 1.4 directs the City to present to City Council for considerations a Water Conservation and Disclosure Ordinance. The core strategy is to implement an Outdoor Landscaping Ordinance that requires use of weather-based irrigation controllers.

Supporting strategies to meet these targets are to record the annual volume percentage of recycled water used and planned to be introduced through 2035 and pursue additional financial resources and incentives for implementing energy and water efficiency measures identified by the conservation and ordinances, and to promote the expansion of greywater systems.

The City is also launching Pure Water San Diego, a phased, multi-year program that will provide one-third of San Diego's water supply locally by 2035. The Pure Water Program will use proven water purification technology to clean recycled water to produce safe, high-quality drinking water. The program offers a cost-effective investment for San Diego's water needs and will provide a reliable, sustainable water supply.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

The City of San Diego�s Climate Action Plan encompasses both local water and wastewater utilities� operations and include targets to reduce energy consumption at municipal facilities by 15% by 2020 and an additional 25% by 2035 below 2010 levels. Strategies to reach these targets include implementing a Smart Energy Management & Monitoring System for facilities to monitor and track energy consumption and using those results to identify opportunities for great efficiency and demand response along with pursuing LEED for Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance Certification for municipal facilities. San Diego just completed its CAP 2018 Annual Report, on progress towards its CAP goals.

Since 2000, the Public Utilities Department has maintained a California Energy Commission-trained Energy Audit Team. Nearly all of the Department's major facilities have energy audit reports. The Department has invested an average of $400,000 per year in energy efficiency projects which have upgraded almost all of its emergency generators, department-owned administration buildings, as well as many of its largest pump stations and wastewater treatment plants. Projects have included lighting re-lamping and control, air conditioning system improvements, and process improvements.

The City of San Diego�s Wastewater Branch has a multiple self-generating facilities and projects. The City also has a goal to capture 98% wastewater treatment gases by 2035. At the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant, methane gas is captured to fuel three generators for a total capacity of 5.7 MW. The system also produces heat which is used to heat the plant�s digesters. Methane capture is also utilized on two other sites, the Metro Bio solids Center (MBC) and the North City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP). The MBC has a cogeneration capacity of 6.4 MW and the NCWRP has a cogeneration capacity of 3.8 MW. The Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant has an adjacent 1.35 MW hydroelectric plant that captures the energy of the treated wastewater discharge as it flows down a 90 foot-drop from the plant to the ocean outfall.

In 2017, PG&E reported savings of 28.00 MMtherms from natural gas efficiency programs, representing 1.45% of its retail sales. These figures cover the entire California service territory, not just San Jose. PG&E offers electric and natural gas efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and commercial/industrial customers.

San Jose partners with PG&E to promote and administer the Silicon Valley Energy Watch, which serves all of Santa Clara County with energy efficiency services, outreach, and training. Currently, the City of San Jose advocates to the state for additional energy efficiency program resources through the Local Government Sustainable Energy Coalition, on which the city maintains a board seat.

San Jose partners with PG&E to promote and administer the Silicon Valley Energy Watch (SVEW), which serves a total of fourteen jurisdictions located in Santa Clara County. The purpose of the program is to deliver innovative and comprehensive energy efficiency services and outreach to hard-to-reach customers, specifically local governments, nonprofits, small- and medium-sized businesses, and low-income residents. SVEW's overarching goal is to ensure that its targeted customers take advantage of the range of audits, rebates, and technical support that are offered. SVEW has helped to save over 35 million kWh of energy since its inception. In addition to helping to bring in direct, claimable energy savings, SVEW receives funding to conduct non-resource activities that align with the goals of the California Long-Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission in 2008.

A recently launched non-resource project is the Energy Innovation Grant (EIG) Program, which will build the capacity of municipal governments in Santa Clara County to deliver innovative, effective, and replicable projects to encourage the adoption of energy efficient practices among targeted communities and sectors served by SVEW. A total of $180,000 is available for grants through this program in 2017.

The San Jose Municipal Water System offers free water fixtures for its San Jose customers, including showerheads and kitchen and bathroom faucet aerators, and has also started to partner with PG&E to increase conservation efforts. Silicon Valley Energy Watch includes information on water conservation in its Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Home Energy Saving Toolkit. Residents who check out a kit may keep low-flow faucet aerators, a low-flow showerhead, and water leak detection tablets.

San Jos� Municipal Water System (Muni Water) continues to implement water efficiency practices and new technologies that meet and exceed its water savings goals for multiple agencies and programs. For example, Muni Water has already met and exceeded its California SB-X7-7 2020 goal of 145 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) by reaching 126 GPCD in 2015. This is monitored and tracked through each retailer's Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP). Muni Water is also actively working towards reaching California�s recently passed AB-1668 bill calling for an indoor residential water usage of 50 GPCD in 2030. Muni Water is working towards that goal in conjunction with Climate Smart San Jos�, which sets the residential GPCD target to 42 GPCD by 2030. Water-efficient practices continue to remain in place and new technologies are being implemented to continue the reduction of water use to meet these goals.

San Jose Municipal Water System continues to implement its enhanced water conservation outreach efforts. San Jose�s General Plan also outlines specific water savings targets, which include reducing citywide per capita water consumption by 25% by 2040 below 2010 levels and achieving 50 million gallons per day of water conservation savings in San Jose, by reducing water use and increasing water-use efficiency by 2040.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

Although there is not an energy efficiency goal established for municipal water service operations, the wastewater utility has implemented a number of energy efficiency measures, including installing more efficient fine bubble diffusers in its aeration tanks, as well as practicing pulsed, or episodic aeration, both of which significantly reduce energy demands for the aeration process. The wastewater utility has also installed LED streetlights throughout its 170-acre campus, and it continues to evaluate additional energy conservation measures. In addition, the wastewater utility is undergoing a $1.4 billion, 10-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The CIP has plans to invest in energy efficiency projects including $36.4 million aeration tanks rehabilitation and blower improvement projects which will reduce up to 40% of kWh and $1 million annually in secondary treatment once these projects are completed. The wastewater utility self-generates approximately half its energy supply through the capture and use of digester gas.

Public Lighting

Washington has not adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association�s Model Lighting Ordinance. The recently updated Sustainable DC 2.0 plan calls for �replacing all street and public lighting with high efficiency fixtures that protect public health, reduce light pollution, and don�t harm wildlife� (EN1.3). As District government continues its Streetlight Modernization project, the plan directs it to use lights with a color temperature no greater than 3,000 Kelvin, and to ensure that fixtures direct light downward. Approximately 5% of public lighting has been upgraded to LEDs.

The�Green Building Act of 2006�requires that new city building designs earn an ENERGY STAR target finder score of at least 75 and that all city buildings 10,000 square feet and larger be ENERGY STAR�benchmarked annually. This policy applies to publicly funded buildings. All new and significantly renovated city-owned commercial buildings must be at least LEED Silver certified and schools be at least LEED Gold certified.

","","8.5 out of 15 points","The Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), an investor-owned utility, is the primary electric utility serving Washington, DC. Washington Gas is Washington�s primary natural gas utility. The DC Council adopted the Clean and Affordable Energy Act which implemented a DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) to run energy efficiency programs (electric and natural gas) to meet the city council-required performance benchmarks. To learn more about the District�s requirements for electric and gas efficiency, please visit the District of Columbia page of the State Database.

DC Water provides Washington DC with drinking water services and wastewater treatment. The District Department of the Environment manages stormwater for the district.

Last Updated: March 2019
","In 2017, according to PEPCO and DCSEU, together they achieved 73,027 MWh in net incremental savings, representing 0.67% of retail sales. In 2017, Washington Gas and DCSEU reported savings of 1.44 MMtherms from natural gas efficiency programs, representing 1.25% of its retail sales. The figures represented here cover all of the District of Columbia. DCSEU offers electric and natural gas efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and business customers.

Green Energy DC is the District of Columbia's resource for information on energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, products and services in the District. Green Energy DC is a service of the DDOE. Authorized under the Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (CAEA), DDOE contracts with a private entity to conduct sustainable energy programs on behalf of the District government. The CAEA also established a DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) to be the one-stop resource for energy efficiency and renewable energy services for District residents and businesses.� The DCSEU serves under a performance-based contract with DDOE, with input and recommendations from the DCSEU Advisory Board, and oversight from the Council of the District of Columbia.

The District partners with DCSEU, PEPCO, and Washington Gas to promote participation in the energy efficiency programs. The District�s Department of the Environment (DDOE) conducts outreach on all of its sustainability programs on a regular basis. DDOE also works closely with the DC SEU to refer low-income customers who come in through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or the Weatherization ion Assistance Program to the DC SEU for additional energy efficiency services.

In addition, DDOE shares benchmarking data with the DCSEU. The DCSEU uses this raw data to highlight trends and identify customer segments with the greatest potential for cost-effective and significant energy savings. The DCSEU can then use the benchmarking data to target its services and incentives to customers with the greatest need. The DCSEU has been able to utilize the benchmarking data to improve the design of its Commercial & Institutional programs.

","Both PEPCO and Washington Gas provide automated benchmarking services for input into ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. The District government has advocated strongly for improvements in data provision by utilities to building owners and to the city. DCSEU operated a Benchmarking Help Center in 2013 and 2014 that helped 70% of buildings with their reporting and improved their efficiency. DOEE now manages the Benchmarking Help Center and answers hundreds of emails and phone calls annually. The District and Pepco partnered on the U.S. Department of Energy�s Better Building Initiative Energy Data Accelerator.

","City-wide water efficiency and goals

The District of Columbia offers water efficiency programs separately from the energy utilities. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water) developed the award-winning High Usage Notification Application (HUNA) as a free service to proactively notify customers of high water use - including unknown household leaks, sprinklers accidentally left running or ruptured washing machine hoses. The HUNA has generated more than 18,000 notifications to customers since January 2006.

Washington has the goal to decrease total water use by 40% by the end of 2032. DC Water is committed to protecting and preserving the national and local water supply through encouraging water-efficient practices, products, and services. By partnering with the EPA�s WaterSense program, DC Water will offer consumers useful water-saving techniques and encourage them to look for WaterSense labeled products, when making product choices. These products use about 20% less water and perform as well as, or better than, conventional models. Sustainable DC 2.0 established a goal to decrease per capita potable water use by 20% by 2032. Supporting actions include updating the District�s building codes to increase water-efficiency standards and allow the use of alternative water systems, developing incentives for water-efficiency measure in landscaping and buildings, and piloting water efficiency projects in District Government buildings to lead by example.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

DC Water has pursued several projects to reduce energy used for wastewater treatment. They have systematically retrofitted diffuser equipment at the Blue Plains treatment to significantly reduce energy consumed through the treatment process. They have also been improving tidal gates on an ongoing basis to reduce infiltration and water treatment volume.

DC Water, the regional water utility, operates an anaerobic digester to generate electricity and steam from solid waste. The energy facility at the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant uses the solids left over at the end of the wastewater treatment process to create electricity and steam. The project reduces the energy needs of the massive plant by about a third. DC Water expects to expand the capacity and efficiency of the system to meet even more of their energy load in the near future. The Bioenergy facility opened in 2015. It uses thermal hydrolysis to maximize anaerobic digestion.� Blue Plains is the first site in North America to utilize this technology. In recognition of this project, the District of Columbia and DC Water were one of four finalists from across the globe in the �clean energy� category in the C40 Cities awards in December 2016.
